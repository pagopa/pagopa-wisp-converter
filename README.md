### Before the first run

In order to get the latest updated sources and to correctly execute the application, it is necessary to
generate the source classes from WSDL and XSD definition. For doing so, move in `scripts` folder and
execute the following command:

`sh update-specs.sh`

After the execution, the newly generated classes are added in `target/generated-sources/jaxb` folder.
The application now can be run and all the class references are correctly resolved.

### Run the project

`mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local`
